Notes :
1. tokenization : In language processing, the process of break up the string into words and punctuation (tokens).
(Tokenization is the task of cutting a string into identifiable linguistic units that constitute a piece of language data)
2. stemming : The Process of extracting base form of words by removing affixes from them.
3. lemmatization : Making sure that the resulting form of words from normalization is a known word in a dictionary.
